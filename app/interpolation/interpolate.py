def slopes(x, y):
    """
    :func:`slopes` calculates the slope *y*'(*x*)

    The slope is estimated using the slope obtained from that of a
    parabola through any three consecutive points.

    This method should be superior to that described in the appendix
    of A CONSISTENTLY WELL BEHAVED METHOD OF INTERPOLATION by Russel
    W. Stineman (Creative Computing July 1980) in at least one aspect:

      Circles for interpolation demand a known aspect ratio between
      *x*- and *y*-values.  For many functions, however, the abscissa
      are given in different dimensions, so an aspect ratio is
      completely arbitrary.

    The parabola method gives very similar results to the circle
    method for most regular cases but behaves much better in special
    cases.

    Given data vectors *x* and *y*, the slope vector *yp* and a new
    abscissa vector *xi*, the function :func:`stineman_interp` uses
    Stineman interpolation to calculate a vector *yi* corresponding to
    *xi*.

    Here's an example that generates a coarse sine curve, then
    interpolates over a finer abscissa::

      x = linspace(0,2*pi,20);  y = sin(x); yp = cos(x)
      xi = linspace(0,2*pi,40);
      yi = stineman_interp(xi,x,y,yp);

    The interpolation method is described in the article A
    CONSISTENTLY WELL BEHAVED METHOD OF INTERPOLATION by Russell
    W. Stineman. The article appeared in the July 1980 issue of
    Creative Computing with a note from the editor stating that while
    they were:

      not an academic journal but once in a while something serious
      and original comes in adding that this was
      "apparently a real solution" to a well known problem.

    For *yp* = *None*, the routine automatically determines the slopes
    using the :func:`slopes` routine.

    *x* is assumed to be sorted in increasing order.

    For values ``xi[j] < x[0]`` or ``xi[j] > x[-1]``, the routine
    tries an extrapolation.  The relevance of the data obtained from
    this, of course, is questionable...
